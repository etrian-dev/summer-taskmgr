* Handle input for filtering processes
* Calculate per-process CPU usage (load avg)
* Provide other task sorting criteria (3 available now in src/proc_info.c) and a way to dynamically switch between them
* Separate threads handling data refresh at different rates are implemented, but not tested mush (still crashes sometimes)
* Make the drawing process more efficient by having data alloc'd on the heap that is modified based
on deltas with the previous iteration, instead of having local fixed-sized buffers
* Maybe use ncurses forms instead of plain text?
* Handle SIGINT to terminate cleanly the process (either with a signal handler or some dedicated thread)
* Handle SIGALRM (and set a 1s alarm) to refresh the windows in the main thread, rather that the nanosleep inside a while
