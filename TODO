* Handle input for filtering processes
* Calculate per-process CPU usage (load avg)
* Make the drawing process more efficient by having data alloc'd on the heap that is modified based
on deltas with the previous iteration, instead of having local fixed-sized buffers (sort of)
* Maybe use ncurses forms instead of plain text?
* Handle SIGINT to terminate cleanly the process (either with a signal handler or some dedicated thread)
* Handle SIGALRM (and set a 1s alarm) to refresh the windows in the main thread, rather that the nanosleep inside a while
