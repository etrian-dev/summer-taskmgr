* Fix thread count
* Search in PID, username and other fields for patterns
* Calculate per-process CPU usage (load avg)
* Make the drawing process more efficient by having data alloc'd on the heap that is modified based
on deltas with the previous iteration, instead of having local fixed-sized buffers (sort of)
* Maybe use ncurses forms instead of plain text?
* Handle SIGINT to terminate cleanly the process (either with a signal handler or some dedicated thread)
* Maybe use a GSequence instead of a GSList for the process's open file descriptor list
(or any data structure optimized for searches and easily maintained ordered, really)
* put commands onscreen (for instance on the last line, similar to htop). It could even be
a dynamic command prompt used to control the program's behaviour
* Implement menu location reading from the /share subdir or the base directory to ease testing
* Solve additional garbage on the command field of processes, likely from a static buffer or some
 leaked memory
